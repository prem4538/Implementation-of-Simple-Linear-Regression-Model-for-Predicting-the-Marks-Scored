# Implementation-of-Simple-Linear-Regression-Model-for-Predicting-the-Marks-Scored

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the simple linear regression model for predicting the marks scored.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
### 1.
go to moodle,click the link and fork the experiment to your git hub account and again click fork
### 2.
create new folder in documents and name as my project 
### 3.
open visual studio code and clone the repositories to it 
### 4.
run necessary code in terminal and generate output and take screen shot of it make pdf and submit url link in moodle 

## Program:
```
